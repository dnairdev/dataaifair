# DataAIFair IDE

An AI-assisted IDE that promotes critical thinking and codebase familiarity while preventing skill atrophy.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Traditional AI coding assistants like ChatGPT and Cursor have two critical issues:

1. **Critical Thinking Atrophy**: Engineers become dependent on AI, losing their ability to think through problems independently
2. **Codebase Disconnection**: Developers become less familiar with their own codebase when AI writes and debugs code for them

## ✨ Our Solution

DataAIFair IDE addresses these problems through:

### 🧠 Learning-Focused AI Assistance
- **Progressive Disclosure**: AI provides hints and questions rather than complete solutions
- **Guided Exploration**: Interactive code exploration sessions that require active engagement
- **Contextual Learning**: AI suggestions that teach concepts, not just provide answers

### 📊 Gamified Learning System
- **Critical Thinking Score**: Tracks your analytical and problem-solving skills
- **Codebase Familiarity**: Measures how well you understand your codebase
- **Learning Streaks**: Encourages consistent engagement
- **Achievements**: Rewards learning milestones and skill development

### 🎯 Key Features

#### Interactive Code Exploration
- Start guided exploration sessions for any file
- Answer thought-provoking questions about code structure
- Learn about patterns, dependencies, and architecture
- Build understanding through active analysis

#### Smart AI Suggestions
- **Hints**: Gentle nudges in the right direction
- **Questions**: Thought-provoking prompts that require analysis
- **Explanations**: Educational content about concepts and patterns
- **Challenges**: Hands-on exercises to test understanding

#### Learning Panel
